              Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes

              track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad, aggregate 
              demographic information. </p>
            
            
            
              <p><strong> Customer Service</strong> <br>
               We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested

              <p><strong> Legal Disclaimer</span></strong> <br>
               Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may 
              need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein 
              we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply 
              with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process 
              served on our Web site. </p>
            
            
            
              <p><strong> Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong><br>
               We do not share aggregated demographic information with our 
              partners and advertisers. </p>
            
            
            
              <p><strong> Third-Party Advertisers</strong> <br>
               We do not share any data with third-party advertisers </p>
            
            
            
              <p><strong> Security</span></strong> <br>
               This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
              When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their 
              information is protected both on- and off- line. </p>

            <p>When our order 
              form asks users to enter sensitive information such as credit card 
              number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the 
              best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure 
              page, such as our order form, the icon on the bottom right of Web 
              browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
              becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked or open, when users are 
              just 'surfing'. </p>
            <p>While we use SSL 
              encryption to protect sensitive information on-line, we also do 
              everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All 
              of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned 
              above, is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need 
              the information to perform a specific job, for example, our customer 
              service representatives, are granted access to personally identifiable 
              information.</p>

            <p><strong> Notification of Changes</strong> <br>
               If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those 
              changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places 
              we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information 
              we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, 
              we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
              policy under which the information was collected. </p>
